shortdesc: Example showing a vector layer styled with a gradient.
docs: >
  This example creates a [`CanvasGradient`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/CanvasGradient).
  The vector data is loaded from a file and features are filled with the gradient.
  The same technique can be used with a [`CanvasPattern`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasPattern).
