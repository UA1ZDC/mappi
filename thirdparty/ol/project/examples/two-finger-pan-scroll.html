title: Panning and page scrolling
shortdesc: Shows a map that allows page scrolling unless two fingers or Cmd/Ctrl are used to pan the map.
docs: >
  This example shows a common behavior for page scrolling: on touch devices, when one finger
  is placed on the map, it can be used to scroll the page. Only two fingers will perform drag pan.
  For mouse or trackpad devices, the platform modifier key (Cmd or Ctrl) will enable drag pan on
  the map, otherwise the page will scroll.
