docs: >
  Example assigning a custom color to an icon. The icon styles in this example use images with a white fill. For some features, custom colors set using the `color` property.
  Note that icon files need to obey the same origin policy or send proper CORS headers for this to work. When relying on CORS headers, the `ol/style/Icon` must be configured with `crossOrigin: 'anonymous'`.
