C++ backend
===========

As of protobuf 2.6.0, a new C++ backend for the Python protobuf bindings is
available, which is faster than the default pure Python implementation. It can
be activated by setting the following environment variables:

PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=cpp
PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION=2
