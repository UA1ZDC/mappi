googletest (1.8.0-9) unstable; urgency=medium

  The includes and shared libraries are now shipped in packages
  libgtest-dev and libgmock-dev.  Use one of these packages if
  you wish to link against the system gtest/gmock library for
  testing.

  The sources (for both gtest and gmock) are shipped in package
  googletest.  Use this package if you wish to compile your own
  version of the gtest/gmock library for testing.

  The tool "gmock_gen" is shipped in package googletest-tools.

  NOTE: package libgtest-dev had previously contained the sources,
  so to avoid breaking packages that depend on it for sources,
  libgtest-dev retains a dependency on package googletest.  This
  dependency will be removed in future, so packages that require
  the sources to build are advised to update their dependency to
  "googletest" at the earliest opportunity.


googletest (1.8.0-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  Reinstated compiled libraries for both googletest and googlemock.


googletest (1.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Upstream has merged formerly-separate Google Test and Google Mock
  projects.  The binary package googletest reflects this merge: sources
  for both projects are now installed under /usr/src/googletest.

  The old packages libgtest-dev and google-mock are retained for
  compatibility and provide the old /usr/src/gtest and /usr/src/gmock
  via symlinks.


gtest (1.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  Use of precompiled libgtest is no longer recommended.  See README.Debian
  for instructions on using gtest with your projects.  The precompiled
  shared library has been removed and the static library will be removed
  in a future upload.
  
  The script gtest-config is no longer supplied since upstream's
  autoconfigure-based build is deprecated.
